;Exercise 3.30: Figure 3.27 shows a ripple-carry adder formed by stringing together n full-adders. This is the simplest form of parallel adder for adding two n -bit binary numbers. The
;inputs A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , ..., A n and B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , ..., B n are the two binary numbers to be added (each A k and B k is a 0 or a 1). The circuit generates S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , ..., S
;n , the n bits of the sum, and C , the carry from the addition. Write a procedure ripple-carry-adder that generates this circuit. The procedure should take as arguments three lists of n
;wires eachâ€”the A k , the B k , and the S k â€”and also another wire C . The major drawback of the ripple-carry adder is the need to wait for the carry signals to propagate. What is the
;delay needed to obtain the complete output from an n -bit ripple-carry adder, expressed in terms of the delays for and-gates, or-gates, and inverters?
