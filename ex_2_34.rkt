;Exercise 2.34: Evaluating a polynomial in x at a given value of x can be formulated as an accumulation. We evaluate the polynomial
;a n x n + a n - 1 x n - 1 + ⋯ + a 1 x + a 0
;using a well-known algorithm called Horner’s rule, which structures the computation as
;( ... ( a n x + a n - 1 ) x + ⋯ + a 1 ) x + a 0 .
;In other words, we start with a n , multiply by x , add a n - 1 , multiply by x , and so on, until we reach a 0 .82
;
;Fill in the following template to produce a procedure that evaluates a polynomial using Horner’s rule. Assume that the coefficients of the polynomial are arranged in a sequence, from a
;0 through a n .
;
;(define 
;  (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
;  (accumulate 
;   (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms)
;    ??)
;   0
;   coefficient-sequence))
;
;For example, to compute 1 + 3 x + 5 x 3 + x 5 at x = 2 you would evaluate
;
;(horner-eval 2 (list 1 3 0 5 0 1))
