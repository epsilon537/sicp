;Exercise 2.2: Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor
;make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the
;x coordinate and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and selectors x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using your selectors and
;constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the
;endpoints). To try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:
;
;(define (print-point p)
;  (newline)
;  (display "(")
;  (display (x-point p))
;  (display ",")
;  (display (y-point p))
;  (display ")"))

(define (make-segment start-point end-point)
  (cons start-point end-point))

(define (start-segment seg)
  (car seg))

(define (end-segment seg)
  (cdr seg))

(define (make-point x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (x-point point)
  (car point))

(define (y-point point)
  (cdr point))

(define (average a b)
  (/ (+ a b) 2))

(define (midpoint-segment seg)
  (let ((x1 (x-point (start-segment seg)))
        (x2 (x-point (end-segment seg)))
        (y1 (y-point (start-segment seg)))
        (y2 (y-point (end-segment seg))))
    (make-point (average x1 x2) (average y1 y2))))

(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

(print-point (midpoint-segment (make-segment (make-point 10 20) (make-point 40 -10))))
